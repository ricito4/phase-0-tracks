// first get length of the the array
// set up a for loop that will go to length - 1
// set up an initial variable for the index of the longest string as the 0th index
// iterate through the array comparing the ith and ith+1 element in the array to see which is longer using the .length method
// if the ith + 1 is bigger than the ith then set the index to the ith+1
// when finished return the string at the stored index
