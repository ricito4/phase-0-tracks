VPS (virtual private server)
a virtual machine provided for a price that uses it's own operating system. It is different from operating locally on a computer despite the commands used being similar. Users can operate it remotely with any software that runs on the OS. It functions similarly to physical servers but there are differences.

VPS's are more stable and reliable for web hosting than shared web hosting, have more control compared to shared hosting, use resources more efficiently, have easy scalability, and are less costly for small websites.

While using root gives you access to all facets of your virtual machine it isn't a default setting for non-administrative users. While all commands are availble to root, others cannot be accessed when signing in as something else.
