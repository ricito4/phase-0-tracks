Create a Markdown file called notes.md in phase-0-tracks/web_dev/jquery (you'll have to create the directory as well). Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

First look up what it is used for. Then look up how to create files and how they interact with programs we have already tackled. From here find how syntax of the language and any useful cheatsheets for simple commands. Before jumping into a project see if I can do simple commands using it before planning something larger scale. From here plan something out that will use jquery and other necessary programs that go along with it.
