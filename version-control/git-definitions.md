# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
Version control is the process of creating different versions of a file or multiple files that can later be merged back together into the master version. It is useful for allowing multiple people to work on the same files, maintaining an original code so that if any mistakes are made they can revert back to the master version, and tracking what changes were made along the way in each branch.   

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch creates a dupicate of a file/files and allows you make changes to a them while maintaining the master file/files. Branches are used so that changes can be made without altering the codebase. They can also be tracked to see what changes were made to a code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is the process letting the computer know you are finished making changes to files you have previously added. The commit is accompanied by a commit message that should detail the changes you have made. If the changes are small then a simple imperative phrase like "Fix the formatting for doc.md" is fine. If the fix is bigger use a subject/body format.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an error that can occur when merging either your current working branch with another branch or vice versa. This can occur for a variety of reasons like when changes are made to the same file and are trying to be merged.
